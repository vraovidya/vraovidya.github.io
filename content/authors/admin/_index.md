I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Arizona State University](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vidya A Chhabria](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/vidyachhabria/). Currently, my research is centered around sustainable computing and chiplet-based heterogeneous integration architecture.

I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from [R.V. College of Engineering](https://www.rvce.edu.in/), I then graduated with a Master's in Electrical Engineering from [Arizona State University](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/). 

I have a strong interest in fitness, and in my leisure time, I engage in long-distance running.
